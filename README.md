<h2>How It's Made:</h2>
<p>Technologies used include HTML, CSS, JavaScript</p>

<h3>In Action:</h3>
<p>Use buttons to add to, save, or clear count. The add button will add to the total count. The save button will save the current count to the previous entries section and restart the count at zero. The clear button will clear the previous entries section.  </p>

<h2>Optimizations:</h2>
<p>In addition to project requirements, I included a clear function that clears the previous entries. I used event listeners instead of the "onclick" in HTML. I also used an array to manipulate and hold the entries instead of adding them directly to the output.</p>

<h2>Lessons Learned:</h2>
<p>With this project, I was able to explore using a data structure to store and manipulate data. I found it more efficient to use an array to store the count, rather than concatenating it to a holding variable every save.</p>
